## Site Functionality

As stated, logged in users can create and share recipes and tips/tricks via posts, but logged in users can do much more. They can also edit their recipes and posts in addition to being able to comment on any recipe and/or post. Users can also edit those comments that they have created.

As seen below, you can add a comment and edit an already existing comment that you have created.
